    <p>Spaghetti is a classic Italian pasta dish made from long, thin noodles typically served with a sauce. The noodles are usually boiled until they are tender but still slightly firm to the bite, then topped with a variety of sauces such as marinara, bolognese, or Alfredo. Spaghetti is a versatile and satisfying meal that can be enjoyed with simple ingredients or dressed up with additional toppings like meatballs or vegetables.</p>
